In this project we will try to apply feature selection methods for classification problems.

For our dataset (450 ratio variables) we study two classification problems:

* Either predict if an area belongs to an Urban Rural Class ([http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Statistics/About/Methodology/UrbanRuralClassification]()) and more specifically on category 1 (Settlements of 125,000 or more people).  **[folder /class]**
* OR compare the mean prices of 2012 with 2011 in order to find if the prices went UP or DOWN.  **[folder /regtoclass]**
